> Run multiple Copilot agents in parallel. One taskbar icon to manage them all.

Modern AI-assisted development isn't one task at a time — it's **multiple Copilot agents running simultaneously** across different repos, branches, and contexts. But juggling terminals, IDEs, and browsers for each agent creates a context-switching tax that kills the productivity gains.

**Copilot Booster** eliminates that overhead. Pin it to your taskbar and get **complete isolation per session** — each Copilot agent gets its own terminal, IDE workspace, and browser instance, all tracked and instantly accessible from a single icon. No more hunting for the right window. No more losing context. Just click and focus.

### Why Copilot Booster?

| Without Copilot Booster | With Copilot Booster |
|---|---|
| Alt-Tab through dozens of windows to find the right terminal | Click the session → focus the exact terminal, IDE, or browser |
| Manually track which agent is working on what | Live Running column shows Terminal, Copilot CLI, IDE, Edge, and Explorer status per session |
| One shared browser for all research | Isolated Edge workspaces per session — tabs saved and restored automatically |
| Context-switch between repos by cd-ing around | Git worktree workspaces give each agent its own branch and directory |
| Lose track of parallel agents after a restart | Window handles, terminals, and Edge tabs all persist across restarts |
| No idea when an agent finishes | 🔔 Bell notifications with popups when a session is ready |

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/menu-tasks.png" alt="Jump list with tasks" width="300">
</p>

- **New Copilot Session** — start a new session with a smart directory picker
- **Existing Sessions** — browse, resume, or open sessions in your IDE
- **Settings** — configure tools, directories, and IDEs

---

### 🔄 Session Browser & Active Context Tracking

The session browser is the central hub. Each session shows **Session**, **CWD** (with ⎇ for Git repos), **Date**, **Running**, and **Ctx.** (context) columns — giving you a live view of what's running where. The **Ctx.** column displays file and Edge tab icons with counts, allowing quick access to session content. Sessions with active processes are automatically sorted to the top.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/session-browser-state.png" alt="Session browser with active tracking, bell notifications, and status indicators" width="700">
</p>

The **Running** column tracks running contexts across multiple environments:

| Context | How it's detected |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Terminal** | Windows launched via "Open Terminal" are tracked by PID and cached across restarts |
| **Copilot CLI** | Detected via `events.jsonl` content parsing — working (spinner) or idle (bell) |
| **IDE** | IDEs launched via the Open menu are tracked by window handle and cached across restarts |
| **Edge** | Browser workspaces tracked via UI Automation anchor-tab detection |
| **Explorer** | Explorer windows opened via context menu are tracked by HWND |
| **Files** | Session files folder opened via context menu |

Each active context is a **clickable link** — click to focus the corresponding window instantly. Re-opening an IDE that's already tracked for a session will focus the existing window instead of launching a new instance.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/Focus-Feature-Per-Session.gif" alt="Click-to-focus across Terminal, IDE, and Edge per session" width="700">
</p>

#### 📑 Custom Session Tabs

Organize your sessions into custom tabs — up to 10 tabs with full drag-and-drop reordering. Add new tabs directly from the main window with the **+** button, or manage them in Settings.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/organize-your-sessions.png" alt="Session tabs with drag-and-drop reordering" width="700">
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/custom-multiple-tabs.png" alt="Multiple custom session tabs for organizing work" width="700">
</p>

- **Quick add (+) button** — create new tabs directly from the session tab strip without opening Settings
- **Drag-and-drop columns** — reorder grid columns by dragging headers; column order is persisted across restarts (Status column stays pinned)
- **Drag-to-tab** — drag selected sessions onto a different tab header to move them between tabs
- **Move sessions between tabs** — right-click → "Move to" to reassign sessions to any tab

Other session browser features:
- **Multi-select** — hold Ctrl for individual selection or Shift for range selection; batch Pin/Unpin and Move to tab via context menu
- **Search** — filter sessions by title, folder, or metadata as you type
- **Pinned sessions** — pin sessions to keep them at the top regardless of sorting
- **Running-first sorting** — sessions with active processes automatically float to the top
- **Auto-select on tab switch** — switching tabs immediately selects the first row for quick navigation
- **Auto-refresh** — the list updates when new sessions appear or names change externally
- **Auto-cleanup** — empty sessions with no activity are automatically removed

---

### 🔔 Session Status & Notifications

The status column shows live session state with animated icons — a **spinning blue indicator** when Copilot CLI is working, and a **🔔 red bell** when it's idle and waiting for input. Bell rows are highlighted with a prominent red background for quick visual scanning.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/session-state-notification.png" alt="Session status column showing bell and spinner icons with red notification rows" width="700">
</p>

When a session finishes work, a **Windows notification** pops up with the session name. Status detection is powered by content-based parsing of `events.jsonl` — it understands assistant turns, tool requests, and `ask_user` pauses.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/toast-notification.png" alt="Notification when session is ready" width="350">
</p>

- **Content-based detection** — parses event types (assistant.turn_start, tool.execution_start, ask_user) for accurate status
- **One-shot notifications** — each bell only fires once per idle transition
- **Staleness threshold** — sessions inactive for 30+ minutes are ignored to prevent false bells
- **Startup-aware** — existing idle sessions don't trigger false notifications when the app launches
- **Persistent bell state** — bell notifications survive app restarts
- **Configurable** — toggle notifications on/off in Settings

---

### 📋 Right-Click Context Menu

Right-click any session row to access all actions in a single context menu with system icons:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/context-menu.png" alt="Right-click context menu with icons, IDE sub-menus, and all session actions" width="300">
</p>

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Open Files** | Sub-menu listing session files (plan.md, files/ contents) with shell icons; top item opens session folder |
| **Open Session** | Resume the session in its original working directory |
| **Edit Session** | Rename the session or change its working directory |
| **Pin / Unpin** | Pin sessions to keep them at the top of the list |
| **Move to →** | Move sessions between configurable tabs |
| **Open as New Copilot Session** | Start a fresh Copilot CLI session in the same directory |
| **Open as New Copilot Session Workspace** | Create a Git worktree workspace (Git repos only) |
| **Open Terminal** | Launch a terminal via Windows Terminal (wt.exe) |
| **Open in Explorer (CWD)** | Open the working directory in Explorer |
| **Open in {IDE}** | Sub-menu with CWD/Repo Root folders + matched project files |
| **Open in Edge** | Launch a managed Edge browser workspace |
| **Save Edge State** | Manually save Edge tabs (visible when Edge is open) |
| **Delete Session** | Soft-delete a session (last item, separated) |

---

### 🔍 IDE File Pattern Matching

Configure file patterns per IDE (e.g., `*.sln;*.slnx`) in Settings. When a pattern is set, the IDE context menu becomes a **sub-menu** that searches for matching project files and shows them for quick one-click opening.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/context-menu-ide-submenu.png" alt="IDE sub-menu showing CWD/Repo Root and matched .sln file" width="400">
</p>

- **Fast search** — uses `git ls-files` for Git repos (respects .gitignore), falls back to directory walk with configurable ignored directories
- **Depth-sorted** — shallowest matches shown first, up to 5 results
- **Configurable exclusions** — manage ignored directories (node_modules, bin, obj, etc.) in the "IDE Search" settings tab

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/settings-ide-search.png" alt="IDE Search settings tab with ignored directories" width="400">
</p>

---

### 🌐 Edge Browser Workspaces

Open a managed Microsoft Edge window linked to any session. Each workspace gets a unique anchor tab that lets Copilot Booster track, focus, and detect whether the browser window is still open.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/session-browser-state.png" alt="Edge browser workspace with session anchor tab" width="700">
</p>

- **Tab save/restore** — save Edge tabs via "Save Edge State" in the context menu; tabs are restored when reopening Edge for the session
- **Active tracking** — the Edge workspace appears as a clickable link in the Running column
- **Session name in tab** — the anchor tab title shows the session name; updates live when you change the alias
- **Manual save** — "Save Edge State" context menu button saves all open tabs for the session
- **Tab-level detection** — uses UI Automation to find the anchor tab across all Edge windows
- **Auto-cleanup** — when you close the anchor tab or the Edge window, the workspace is automatically removed from tracking

---

### 📂 Smart Directory Picker

The **New Session** dialog shows your most-used working directories — sorted by frequency across all previous sessions. Non-existent paths are automatically cleaned up.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/new-session-tab.png" alt="New Session dialog with directory picker and session counts" width="700">
</p>

Each directory shows:
- **# Sessions created** — how many sessions have used this path
- **Git** — whether the directory is inside a Git repository (including worktrees)

Right-click any directory to access all actions, or double-click to quickly start a new session with a name prompt.

---

### 🌿 Git Workspace Creation

For Git-enabled directories, Copilot Booster can create isolated workspaces backed by [git worktrees](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree). Each workspace gets its own branch and directory — perfect for working on multiple features in parallel without stashing or switching branches.

Create a workspace from two places:
- **New Session** → right-click a Git directory → **New Copilot Session Workspace**
- **Existing Sessions** → right-click a session → **Open as New Copilot Session Workspace**

Workspaces are stored by default in `%APPDATA%\CopilotBooster\Workspaces\` and named after the repository and branch (e.g., `myrepo-feature-xyz`). The workspace directory can be changed in Settings.

The workspace dialog offers three modes:

#### Existing Branch

Check out an existing branch into its own worktree. The branch dropdown lists all local and remote branches.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/create-workspace-specific-branch.png" alt="Create workspace from an existing branch" width="450">
</p>

#### New Branch

Create a new branch based on any existing branch. Pick a base branch from the dropdown and name your new branch.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/create-workspace-new-based-branch.png" alt="Create workspace with a new branch from a base branch" width="450">
</p>

#### From PR #

Start a workspace directly from a GitHub PR number. Copilot Booster fetches the PR metadata via the GitHub API and checks out the contributor's original branch name — matching what `gh pr checkout` does.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/create-workspace-from-pr.png" alt="Create workspace from a GitHub Pull Request" width="450">
</p>

### ⚙️ Settings

All configuration lives in a tabbed UI with info labels and tooltips — no JSON editing required.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/settings-tab.png" alt="Settings dialog with General, Copilot CLI, IDEs, Spotlight, and other tabs" width="700">
</p>

- **Theme** — choose between System (default), Light, or Dark theme; persisted across restarts
- **Date format** — choose between `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm`, `MM/DD hh:mm AM/PM`, or `DD/MM HH:mm`; the Date column auto-sizes to fit
- **Notify on bell** — toggle Windows notifications when sessions finish work
- **Always on top** — keep the window above other windows
- **Auto-hide on focus** — hide other session windows when focusing one
- **Max active sessions** — configurable limit (0 = unlimited)
- **Pinned order** — sort pinned sessions by last updated or alias name
- **Default Work Dir** — set the default working directory for new sessions
- **Workspace Dir** — set the directory where Git worktree workspaces are stored (default: `%APPDATA%\CopilotBooster\Workspaces\`)
- **Spotlight** — enable/disable the spotlight feature and auto-hiding independently, configure position (6 options), target screen (per-monitor), and slide animation

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/settings-spotlight.png" alt="Spotlight settings with enable, position, screen, auto-hide, and animation options" width="700">
</p>

#### 🛠️ Allowed Tools

Whitelist shell commands and MCP tools that Copilot can use **without prompting for confirmation**. Each entry is passed as `--allow-tool` when launching the Copilot CLI, so matching commands execute immediately — no manual approval needed.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/global-allowed-tools.png" alt="Allowed Tools settings tab" width="500">
</p>

On first run, the list is empty. Here are some commonly used tools:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `shell(git log:*)` | Git log commands |
| `shell(git diff:*)` | Git diff commands |
| `shell(git status:*)` | Git status commands |
| `shell(Set-Location:*)` | Change directory in PowerShell |
| `mcp__github-mcp-server` | GitHub MCP server tools |

> **Tip:** Use wildcards (`*`) to allow all sub-commands under a prefix. For example, `shell(git log:*)` covers `git log`, `git log --oneline`, and any other git log variation.

#### 📁 Allowed Directories

Grant Copilot access to specific directories on your machine. Each entry is passed as `--add-dir` when launching the Copilot CLI, expanding the set of paths Copilot can read and write to.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/global-allowed-directories.png" alt="Allowed Directories settings tab" width="500">
</p>

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `D:\repo` | Your repository root |
| `~\.copilot` | Copilot session state |

> **Tip:** Add your top-level project folders so Copilot can navigate across repositories without being blocked by directory restrictions.

#### 🌐 Allowed URLs

Whitelist URLs that Copilot CLI can access without prompting. These are stored in the Copilot CLI global config (`~/.copilot/config.json`) as `allowed_urls`.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/global-allowed-urls.png" alt="Allowed URLs settings tab" width="500">
</p>

#### 💻 IDEs

Register your favorite IDEs — Visual Studio, VS Code, Rider, Eclipse, or any editor with a command-line launcher. Each IDE entry includes a description, executable path, and optional file pattern (e.g., `*.sln;*.slnx`) for automatic project file discovery in the context menu.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/custom-ide-setup.png" alt="IDE settings with Add IDE dialog showing description, path, and file pattern" width="500">
</p>

#### 🔎 IDE Search

Manage directories excluded from IDE file pattern search (e.g., `node_modules`, `bin`, `obj`).

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/settings-ide-search.png" alt="IDE Search settings tab with ignored directories" width="400">
</p>

#### 📑 Session Tabs

Configure custom session tabs — add, rename, remove, and reorder tabs. The first tab is the default for new sessions.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/settings-session-tabs.png" alt="Session Tabs settings with add, rename, remove, and reorder" width="500">
</p>

### 🔄 In-App Updates

Copilot Booster checks for new versions on startup via the GitHub Releases API. When an update is available, a banner appears at the bottom of the window — click to download and install the latest version automatically.

---

### 🔔 System Tray

Copilot Booster lives in your system tray for instant access. Closing the window minimizes to tray instead of exiting — only **Quit** from the tray menu exits the application.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/tray-menu.png" alt="System tray context menu with Show, Settings, and Quit" width="150">
</p>

- **Double-click** the tray icon to show/restore the window
- **Right-click** for quick access to Show, Settings, or Quit
- The tray icon is always visible while the app is running
